# Decisions

Each entry: what was decided, why, and what would reverse it. Dated so stale
reasoning is visible.

## D1 — Separate repo from `homepage`
**2026-08-19 · settled**

CanWas is its own repo rather than another route on `homepage`.

`homepage` routes are self-contained toys: one route file plus a lazy pair.
CanWas needs a worker, IndexedDB, an overlay renderer, and eventually ~20 MB of
model weights. That weight would degrade the homepage build and cache for a
feature most visitors never open, and `onnxruntime-web` alone violates
homepage's minimal-dependency rule. Precedent exists: `danmaku-ninja`,
`yolo-stream-detect`, `online-screen-recorder`.

homepage links out to it.

## D2 — DOM rendering, not a canvas library
**2026-08-19 · settled**

See [architecture](architecture.md#rendering-dom-not-canvas) for the full
argument. Short version: text selection is the product, canvas has none, so a
canvas build re-adds DOM text on top and maintains two coordinate systems forever.

**Reverses if:** node counts pass a few thousand *and* viewport culling isn't
enough. Not expected.

## D3 — OCR deferred behind an interface, mock ships first
**2026-08-19 · settled**

No real engine in the skeleton. `Recognizer` is defined now and `MockRecognizer`
returns plausible fake `Word[]` after an artificial delay.

A no-op returning nothing would leave the overlay layer — the hardest part of the
app — untestable, deferring the risk rather than removing it. Fake data of the
right shape lets the overlay, its zoom behaviour, and every loading state be
built and proven before an engine exists. Swapping in the real one is then a
one-line change.

## D4 — PaddleOCR PP-OCRv5 as the eventual engine, hand-rolled pipeline
**2026-08-19 · provisional**

When OCR lands: `onnxruntime-web` plus official PP-OCRv5 weights, with
pre/postprocess written here rather than taken from a wrapper package.

Tesseract.js is more trusted by download count but materially worse at zh-TW.
`ppu-paddle-ocr` wraps the right models but is a single-maintainer package;
its 274 KB of pre/postprocess is small enough to read and own instead of depend
on. `Paddle.js` (the official PaddlePaddle JS repo) is dead — last code commit
2022-09-02 — and ships v2/v3-era models. Measurements in
[OCR research](ocr-research.md).

**Reverses if:** the hand-rolled DBNet postprocess proves a time sink. Fallback
is Tesseract.js behind the same `Recognizer` interface, accepting worse CJK.

## D5 — Multiple separate Boards, not pages within one board
**2026-08-19 · settled**

Each Board is an independent document with its own canvas and IndexedDB record.
A Home screen lists them. No nesting.

Flat is the smaller data model and the smaller URL space, and no use case yet
needs images to move between pages of one document. A two-level
board→page hierarchy can be added later; unwinding one is harder.

---

## D6 — Hash router
**2026-08-19 · settled**

GitHub Pages serves a project site under a subpath and 404s on deep-link refresh
for non-hash routes unless a `404.html` redirect shim is added. Hash history has
no such problem. `homepage` moved *away* from hash because it wants clean URLs
for a public CV; CanWas is a tool and does not care.

---

## D7 — Dark theme only
**2026-08-19 · settled**

One theme, no toggle, no light-mode tokens. A reference board is looked at for
long stretches against image content; a light chrome competes with the images.
Halves the token surface and removes a whole class of contrast bugs.

**Reverses if:** anyone actually asks. Tokens are structured so a light block
could be added in one place.

---

## D8 — Base UI over Radix
**2026-08-19 · provisional**

`@base-ui-components/react`, currently `1.0.0-rc.0`.

Chosen on request. Note it is pre-stable and its API may shift before 1.0, unlike
`radix-ui@1.6.7` used on homepage. Usage is deliberately shallow — dialog, popover,
tooltip, menu — so a swap stays cheap.

---

## D9 — No `tailwind-merge`
**2026-08-19 · provisional**

`clsx` only.

`tailwind-merge` earns its place when `className` overrides compose through
several layers of shared wrapper components. CanWas styles at the call site and
has few reusable styled components. Dropping it is one fewer dependency to
maintain.

**Reverses if:** class-conflict bugs appear. One-line add, no refactor.

---

## D10 — No Tailwind theme extension
**2026-08-19 · settled**

No custom colors or variables registered in Tailwind config. Stock palette and
scale only.

Requested constraint. Keeps the design inside a system everyone already knows
and stops a bespoke token vocabulary from growing.

---

## D11 — i18n from day one, homepage's pattern minus the scramble
**2026-08-19 · settled**

A `translations` dictionary keyed by translation key, each with `zh-TW` / `en-US`
values, a `useTranslation()` hook, and a jotai atom persisted to `localStorage` —
ported from `homepage/src/translations.ts`.

The scramble transition effect is not ported; it is homepage personality, not
infrastructure. Retrofitting i18n after strings are scattered is expensive, so it
goes in before there are strings to scatter.

---

## D12 — Playwright for happy-path E2E, with screenshots
**2026-08-19 · settled**

The core interaction is pointer-driven and clipboard-driven. Unit tests cannot
tell you that pasting an image put a node under the cursor at the right zoom.
Scope is deliberately one happy path, not a regression net.
